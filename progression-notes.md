These notes refer to the contents and apply tasks in [learning progression with la schema](learning-progression-with-la-schema.md).

**Step** | **Target program components** | **Apply tasks**
-- | -- | --
1 | 5 screensavers | Minimal piece of code with shown behavior
2 | Main program | Minimal versions of familar programs with structure
3 | Main program | Full functionality of work and sleep modes with minimal contents
4 | Main + screensavers | More elaborate versions of ss
5 | Function-based ss (e.g. bouncing ball)| Implement as functions (no need for classes)
6 | Class-based ss (e.g. rain) | Implement as classes
7 | Func and class-based ss | Iterative improvement
8 | Main + screensavers | Mapping of ss + array-based ss behaviors
9 | `LedSprite`, `game` | Compare and borrow into target components
10 | Extensions of past programs (incl. main & ss) | Experiments to show dynamics
11 | Coding simulation + 5 ss | Smoothing the display  
12 | Coding simulation + 5 ss | Randomization of behaviors    

**For later LP:**
1. Stack frames: here or further along the curriculum (if so, where?)   
2. [interfaces](https://makecode.microbit.org/javascript/interfaces)?  
3. Memory layout.  
4. Data structures, abstract data types, and algorithms:  
   - [data structures vs ADTs](https://www.google.com/search?q=data+structure+vs+abstract+data+type&oq=data+structure+vs+&aqs=chrome.0.0l2j69i57j0l5.4669j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)  
   - array, linked-list, map (dictionary, hash table), tree   
   - stack, queue  
   - sorting  
6. Debugging  
   - micro:bit [error](https://makecode.microbit.org/device/error-codes) [codes](https://support.microbit.org/support/solutions/articles/19000016969-micro-bit-error-codes)
